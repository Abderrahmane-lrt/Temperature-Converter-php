# Temperature-Converter-PHP
This project is a simple and user-friendly Temperature Converter web application that allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F). The interface is designed with an orange color theme to visually represent warmth and temperature, enhanced by complementary cool colors for clarity and aesthetic balance.
